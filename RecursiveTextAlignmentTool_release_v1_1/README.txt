HOW TO COMPILE:
===============
Inside the source folder, type the following command to compile the code (tested for Java version 1.6):
"javac *.java"

HOW TO USE THE TOOL
===================

1 - COMMAND LINE INTERFACE:
---------------------------

USAGE: RecursiveAligmentTool <refFilename> <candFilename> <outputFilename> -opt <configFile>

<refFilename> is the reference (ground truth) text filename
<candFilename> is the candidate (OCR output) text filename
<outputFilename> is the filename for the alignment output (optional)
<configFile> file must contain the following arguments on each line:
        ignoredChars=<listOfChars>
        alignmentFormat=<COLUMN|LINES> (default is lines)
        level=<W|C> (level of alignment can be either character or word level. Default is W.)

The screen output format is:
        <refFilename> <candFilename> <OCR_accuracy>

Example command: java RecursiveAlignmentTool texts/adventuresofhuck_ground_truth.txt texts/adventuresofhuck00clemrich_OCR_output.txt texts/alignmentOutput.txt -opt config.txt
		
An example configuration file includes the three lines below:
------------------------------
level=CHAR
alignmentFormat=LINES
ignoredChars=,.'";:!?()[]{}<>`-+=/\$@%#|&^*_~
------------------------------


2 - RETAS JAVA API
--------------------------
2.a)
This method returns the alignment output in an ArrayList. 
It does not produce any text output 
	
    public static ArrayList<AlignedSequence> processSingleJob_getAlignedSequence(
            String gtFile,  // input text 1: ground truth text
            String candFile,  // input text 2: OCR output text (or the candidate text)
            String ignoredChars, // The list of characters to be ignored
            String level ) // alignment level: "c" or "w" (for character and word level alignment respectively)    
	
2.b) 

This function produces the alignment at the word or character level and produces a text output file. 
The output file has two formats. One can also choose the characters to be ignored for the alignment. 

Stats st = RecursiveAlignmentTool.processSingleJob(
            gtFile,    // (String) input text 1: ground truth text
            candFile,  // (String) input text 2: OCR output text
            alignmentLevel,  // (String) The level of alignment: 'c' for the character and 'w' for the the word level alignment.
            outputFormat,    // (String) The format of the alignment output: 'column' or 'line' 
            ignoredChars, // (String) The list of characters to be ignored
            alignFile     //  (String) The filename for the alignment output
            );  		

"Stats" object contains the total number of matching characters/words and the total number of chars/words in the input texts. 
OCR accuracy is defined to be the total number of matching chars/words divided by the total number of chars/words in the ground truth file. 
One can calculate OCR accuracy by calling the getOCRaccuracy() method as:

double ocrAccuracy = st.getOCRaccuracy();  
 
2.c)  

If the number of matching chars/words is the only concern, then this method is faster. 

Stats sts[] = RecursiveAlignmentTool.processSingleJob_getAlignmentStatsOnly(
            gtFile,    // (String) input text 1: ground truth text
            candFile,  // (String) input text 2: OCR output text
            ignoredChars, // (String) The list of characters to be ignored
			);
			
sts[0] contains the word level alignment statistics
sts[1] contains the character level alignment statistics
